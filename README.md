# NewGPT
A ground-up implementation of one of the most powerful tools in LLM, transformers, to create a model that generates new text after being trained over a set of learning data, in this case, Shakespeare's works.

input.txt contains a large body of Shakespeare's works 
more.txt contains a sample output of the program (recommmended to check if GPU is not powerful enough to run the code)
